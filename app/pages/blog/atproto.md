# Atmosphere Apps

All the cool kids are doing Software Decentralization.

This post is all about atmosphere. How it's something that we need to live. Without atmosphere we may end up like Arnie in Total Recall. We don't want that.
But thankfully, we have atmosphere. This beautiful concept is used for other things as well. Atmos is a Fellow product that is a vacuum canister used to store coffee.
This keeps your coffee fresh. But arguably, if you drink a lot of coffee you don't need to store it in a vacuum canister. But if you like to be super fancy. There is an
automated vacuum canister that sucks out the air for you. You don't need to twist and turn like a human machine. You press a button and it sucks the air out. Automation.
It's a wonderful thing. We use automation on this blog post. One automation is getting the Bluesky comments. These are fetched during build time and also run time. This means
posts will always have bluesky comments. Whether you like it or not. Under the hood we do fancy ATProto stuff. And that brings us back to Atmosphere. Because it's something
we need to live.
