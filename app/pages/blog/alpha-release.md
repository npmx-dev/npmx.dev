# Announcing npmx: a fast, modern browser for the npm registry

Today we're announcing the alpha release of npmx.dev, a fast, modern browser for the npm registry.

npmx is an open-source project stewarded by a rapidly growing community. It's built for open-source developers, and by extension, everyone who works in the JavaScript ecosystem.

The npmx experience is about speed and simplicity. Our mission is to create tools that make it quicker and easier for package maintainers to manage their packages, and to provide valuable data insights coupled with power-user features to help developers discover packages and make informed decisions about the packages they choose to use.

At the heart of npmx is the web development community. To this end, we're also building rich social features into npmx on top of the [AT Protocol](https://atproto.com/), an open, decentralized network for building social applications. We want to make it easier for developers to connect with each other, share their work, and collaborate on projects, and, ultimately, to build a more vibrant and inclusive web development community through the power of the ecosystem.

## The need for npmx

On January 22nd 2026, Daniel Roe, open-source maintainer and founder, and leader of the [Nuxt](https://nuxt.com/) core team, had an idea, and made [the first commit to the npmx repository](e39e56c08fd1e7bdb556c8565c6b11b3c34c8934). The next day, [Daniel asked on Bluesky](https://bsky.app/profile/danielroe.dev/post/3md3cmrg56k2r) about people's frustrations with the current experience on npmjs.com. The question resonated deeply with the community as they voiced frustrations with the user experience including code browsing, missing data and trust signals including surfacing dependencies, and the friction surrounding the publishing experience.

It was clear there was a huge opportunity to build a fast, modern browser for the npm registry, and that there were people willing to work with Daniel to build it.

## The power of community

Enthusiasm travelled quickly through the network about the idea of npmx, and just a day later, it started to become a reality. In just 24 hours, a growing community had mobilised in the form of contributions to the npmx project, and opened 49 pull requests in a single day.
