npm uses [semantic versioning](https://semver.org/) (semver) to manage package versions. A **semver range** is a string that describes a set of version numbers. On npmx, you can type a semver range into the version filter input on any package page to quickly find matching versions.

## Version format

Every npm version follows the format **MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH**, for example `3.2.1`:

- **MAJOR** - incremented for breaking changes
- **MINOR** - incremented for new features (backwards-compatible)
- **PATCH** - incremented for bug fixes (backwards-compatible)

Some versions also include a **prerelease** tag, such as `4.0.0-beta.1`.

## Common range syntax

| Range            | Meaning                                           | Example matches      |
| ---------------- | ------------------------------------------------- | -------------------- |
| `*`              | Any version                                       | 0.0.2, 3.1.0, 3.2.6  |
| `^3.0.0`         | Compatible with 3.x (same major)                  | 3.0.0, 3.1.0, 3.9.5  |
| `~3.2.0`         | At least 3.2.0, same major.minor                  | 3.2.0, 3.2.1, 3.2.99 |
| `3.2.x`          | At least 3.2.0, same major.minor                  | 3.2.0, 3.2.1, 3.2.99 |
| `>=2.0.0 <3.0.0` | At least 2.0.0 but below 3.0.0                    | 2.0.0, 2.5.3, 2.99.0 |
| `1.2.3`          | Exactly this version                              | 1.2.3                |
| `=1.2.3`         | Exactly this version                              | 1.2.3                |
| `^0.3.1`         | At least 0.3.1, same major.minor (0.x is special) | 0.3.1, 0.3.2         |
| `^0.0.4`         | Exactly 0.0.4 (0.0.x is special)                  | 0.0.4 (only)         |

## Examples

### Find all 3.x versions

Type `^3.0.0` to see every version compatible with major version 3.

### Find patch releases for a specific minor

Type `~2.4.0` to see only 2.4.x patch releases (2.4.0, 2.4.1, 2.4.2, etc.).

### Find versions in a specific range

Type `>=1.0.0 <2.0.0` to see all 1.x stable releases.

### Find a specific version

Type the exact version number, like `5.3.1`, to check if it exists.

### Find prerelease versions

Type `>=3.0.0-alpha.0` to find alpha, beta, and release candidate versions for a major release.
